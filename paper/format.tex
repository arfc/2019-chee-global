\section{Introduction}
\gls{NFC} simulation scenarios are constrained objective functions. 
The objectives are systemic demands such as "1\% power growth", 
while an example of a constraint is the availability of new nuclear 
technology. 
To add ease in setting up nuclear fuel cycle simulations, \gls{NFC}
simulators should bring demand responsive deployment decisions into 
the dynamics of the simulation logic \cite{huff_current_2017}. 
While automated power production deployment is common in most fuel 
cycle simulators, automated deployment of supportive fuel cycle 
facilities is non-existent. 

*- The capabilities in current fuel cycle sims (ORION, etc)

Instead, the user must detail the deployment timeline of all 
supporting facilities or have infinite capacity support facilities. 
Thus, a next generation \gls{NFC} simulator should predictively and 
automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet user defined 
power demand. 
This paper discusses demonstration of a new solution, 
\texttt{d3ploy}, enabling demand driven deployment in \Cyclus. 

\Cyclus is an agent-based nuclear fuel cycle simulation framework 
\cite{huff_fundamental_2016}. 
Each entity (i.e. Region, Institution, or Facility) in the fuel 
cycle is modeled as an agent. 
Institution agents
are responsible for deploying and decommissioning facility agents 
and can represent a legal operating organization such as a 
utility, government, etc \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}. 

The Demand-Driven \Cycamore Archetypes project (NEUP-FY16-10512) 
aims to develop \Cyclus's demand-driven deployment capabilities. 
This capability is developed in the form of a \Cyclus Institution
agent that deploys facilities to meet the front-end and back-end 
fuel cycle demands based on a user-defined commodity demand. 
Its goal is to meet supply for any commodity while minimizing 
oversupply.
This demand-driven deployment capability is referred to as 
\texttt{d3ploy}. 


- The objectives of this paper: explain the capabilities of d3ploy, 
demonstrate how d3ploy is able to meet the primary objective of 
minimizing undersupply and undercapacity, demonstrate d3ploy's use 
in a transition scenario.  

*- What is \Cyclus 

*- What is d3ploy in relation to \Cyclus 

\section{Method}
- describe the capabilities of d3ploy and why they were developed
this way 

- explain the performance tests and what they are meant to 
demonstrate and why each of them was performed. 

- explain each system parameter that will be varied in the results.
System parameters include: supply/capacity buffer, varying calc 
methods for each commodity.  

\section{Results}
- Show the results for each performance test with and without 
supply and capacity buffers. (Scenario 3 and 7 in particular, 
these are the scenarios with a refueling reactor)

- Show the results for one transition scenario with and without
d3ploy. Explain how the use of d3ploy fills the gaps in the 
capability of \Cyclus for modeling transition scenarios. 
[Include a figure of the commodity flow in the transition scenario]  

- highlight the importance of a supply/capacity buffer for 
ensuring that there is enough of each commodity when there is 
a spike due to refueling of a reactor etc. 

\section{Conclusion}
- d3ploy rules!
