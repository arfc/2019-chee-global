\section{Introduction}
For many fuel cycle simulators, it is currently up to the user 
to define a deployment scheme of supporting facilities to ensure 
that there is no gap in the supply chain. 
To ease setting up nuclear fuel cycle simulations, \gls{NFC}
simulators should bring demand responsive deployment decisions into 
the dynamics of the simulation logic \cite{huff_current_2017}. 
Thus, a next generation \gls{NFC} simulator should predictively and 
automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet a user defined 
power demand. 

\Cyclus is an agent-based nuclear fuel cycle simulation framework 
\cite{huff_fundamental_2016}. 
In \Cyclus, each entity (i.e. Region, Institution, or Facility) in the 
fuel cycle is an agent. 
Region agents represent geographical or political areas that institution
and facility agents can be grouped into. 
Institution agents control the 
deployment and decommission of facility agents 
and represents legal operating organizations such as a 
utility, government, etc. \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}. 
Facility agents represent nuclear fuel cycle facilities. 
\Cycamore \cite{carlsen_cycamore_2014}
provides agents to represent process physics of various 
components in the nuclear fuel cycle (e.g. mine, fuel enrichment 
facility, reactor). 

The Demand-Driven \Cycamore Archetypes project 

\noindent
(NEUP-FY16-10512) 
aims to develop \Cyclus's demand-driven deployment capabilities. 
This capability is added as a \Cyclus Institution
agent that deploys facilities to meet the front-end and back-end 
fuel cycle demands based on a user-defined commodity demand. 
This demand-driven deployment capability is called 
\deploy. 

In this paper, we explain the capabilities of \deploy, 
demonstrate how \deploy minimizes undersupply of all 
commodities in a simulation while meeting key simulation 
constraints. 
Constant, linearly increasing, and sinusoidal power demand
transition scenarios are demonstrated. 
Insights are discussed to inform parameter 
input decisions for future work in setting up 
larger transition scenarios that include many facilities.

\section{D3ploy capabilities}
At each time step, \deploy predicts demand and supply of each 
commodity for the next time step.
Then, \deploy deploys facilities to meet predicted demand. 
\Deploy's primary objective is minimizing the number of time 
steps of undersupply of any commodity. 
Figure \ref{fig:flow} shows the flow of \deploy's logic at every time step.

    \end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{\Deploy logic flow at each time step in \Cyclus. }
	\label{fig:flow}
\end{figure*}

When there exists a predicted undersupply of a commodity, 
\deploy will deploy the fewest number of available facilities
to meet the predicted undersupply. 

\subsection{\textbf{Basic User-Defined Input Variables}}
The user inputs specific variables to customize their
simulation. 
Descriptions of each input variable is found in the 
README of the \deploy github repository \cite{d3ploy_doi_2019}.

Essentially, the user must define the facilities for the 
\deploy institution to control and their corresponding capacities. 
The user must also define the driving commodity, its demand 
equation and what method the institution predicts 
demand and supply with. 
For example, the user can define a demand equation for power of 
$1000t$ and \deploy will deploy available reactor and supporting 
facilities to meet the defined power demand. 

The user can also provide a time dependent equation that governs
preference for that facility compared to other facilities that 
provide the same commodity. 
For example, the user can define a \gls{LWR} and a \gls{SFR} to have
preferences of $101-t$ and $t$ respectively. 
The \gls{LWR} will have a larger preference than the \gls{SFR} up to 
time step 50.
Therefore, when there is a demand for power, a \gls{LWR}
will be deployed before time step 51 
while a \gls{SFR} will be deployed after time step 50. 

The user has an option to constrain deployment of a facility 
until a sizable inventory of a specific commodity is accumulated.  
The user can also define an initial facility list of facilities that 
are present in the institution at the beginning of the simulation. 

\subsection{\textbf{Prediction Algorithms}}
Three interchangeable algorithm types govern demand and supply 
predictions: non-optimizing, deterministic optimizing, and stochastic
optimizing. 

Three methods were implemented for the non-optimizing model: 
moving average (MA)
autoregressive moving average (ARMA), autoregressive 
conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH).
Four methods were implemented for the deterministic optimizing model: 
Polynomial fit regression, simple exponential smoothing,  
triple exponential smoothing (holt-winters), and fast fourier 
transform (fft). 
One method was implemented for stochastic optimizing model: 
stepwise seasonal.  

The user can choose which prediction algorithm governs each specific 
\deploy facility. 
The effectiveness of a prediction algorithm depends on the type 
of power demand in a scenario and the type of commodity (demand 
driving commodity vs non-driving commodity, demand driven 
deployment vs supply driven deployment etc.). 
For example, the most effective method
for predicting demand and supply for the power commodity in a scenario  
with a sinusoidal power demand is the triple exponential smoothing method. 
Whereas, for the non-driving commodities in the same 
scenario, the fast fourier transform method is more effective than triple 
exponential smoothing.

    \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\subsection{\textbf{Difference between Demand and Supply Driven Institutions}}
Within \deploy, there are two institutions: \texttt{Demand-}
\texttt{DrivenDeploymentInst} and \texttt{SupplyDrivenDeployment}. 
\texttt{Inst}. 
The prior is used for the front-end of the fuel cycle and the latter is used 
for the back-end. 
Front-end facilities are facilities that exist before the reactor 
in a nuclear fuel cycle such as a fuel fabrication facility etc. 
Back-end facilities are facilities that exist after the reactor in a nuclear 
fuel cycle, such as a reprocessing facility etc. 
The reason for this separation is to let facilities have the choice 
to demand for supply or demand for capacity. 
For example, for front end facilities, the reactor has a demand for 
fuel, using \texttt{DemandDrivenDeploymentInst}, it triggers the fuel 
fabrication facility to deploy facilities to create supply to meet 
the demand. 
Whereas, for back end facilities, the reactor generates spent fuel 
, there is a demand for waste repository facility to accept the 
spent fuel, using \texttt{SupplyDrivenDeploymentInst}, it triggers the
deployment of a waste repository to create a capacity for spent fuel 
to meet the available supply. 

\subsection{\textbf{Installed Capacity}}
The user can choose between deploying facilities based on the difference 
between predicted demand and predicted supply or predicted demand and 
installed capacity. 
There are two reasons for wanting to use installed capacity over predicted 
supply. 
The first is for facilities that provide intermittent supply, such as a 
reactor facility that has a designated refueling time. 
During time steps where a reactor is refueling, the user might not 
want \deploy to deploy more facilities to make up for the lack of supply
caused by this one time step gap in supply. 
The second is for situations where the input commodity for a facility has
run out in a simulation and the facility that produces the input commodity 
is no longer commissionable. 
Therefore, with the demand for the output commodity of that facility, \deploy
would deploy that facility to meet the demand, however due to the lack of 
the input commodity, even if there are infinite numbers of that facility, 
it will not produce the output commodity. 
For example, in a transition scenario to fast reactors that require plutonium 
from \gls{LWR}'s \gls{SNF}, if the fast reactor's demand for plutonium exceeds
the inventory provided by \gls{LWR}s before they were decommissioned, it will 
result in the deployment of mixer facilities that generate the fast reactor 
fuel despite the lack of plutonium to generate the fuel. 
This is an example of a poorly set up transition scenario. 

\subsection{\textbf{Supply/Capacity Buffer}}
In \texttt{DemandDrivenDeploymentInst}, the user can choose to provide a
buffer for predicted supply.
\Deploy will deploy facilities to meet the predicted demand with the 
additional buffer. 

In \texttt{SupplyDrivenDeploymentInst}, the user can choose to 
provide a buffer for predicted capacity.
\Deploy will deploy facilities to meet the predicted supply with the 
additional buffer. 
The buffer can be defined as a percentage value or an absolute value.

\section{Demonstration of d3ploy capabilities}
Constant, linearly increasing and sinusoidal power demand simulations
are shown to demonstrate \deploy's capabilities. 
A balance between the various system parameters must be 
met for each type of simulation to meet the goal of 
minimizing undersupply and under capacity for the various 
commodities. 
The input files and scripts to produce the plots in this paper 
can be reproduced using \cite{d3ploy_doi_2019}. 

These simulations are basic transition scenarios that only includes 
three types of facilities: \texttt{source}, \texttt{reactor} and 
\texttt{sink}.
All of the simulations begin with a ten reactor facilities, 
\texttt{reactor1} to \texttt{reactor10}. 
These reactors have staggered cycle lengths and lifetimes 
so that they do not all refuel and decommission at the same time 
steps. 
\Deploy deploys reactor facilities of \texttt{new reactor} type
to meet unmet demand for power that occurs when the ten initial 
reactor facilities begin to decommission. 
All the simulations deploy facilities based on the relationship
between predicted demand and installed capacity. 
This capability was discussed in the previous section.  
Table \ref{tab:transition-scenario-all} shows the simulation 
parameters that are consistent across all the discussed 
scenarios. 

These basic transition scenarios were set up to 
demonstrate \deploy's capabilities for use in simulating 
transition scenarios and 
also to inform decisions about parameter inputs when setting up larger 
demand transition scenarios that include many facilities.

    \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

In this section, a constant power transition scenario is shown. 
Table \ref{tab:transition-scenario-constant-power} shows the 
simulation parameters used in this transition scenario. 

Figures \ref{fig:constanttransition-power}, \ref{fig:constanttransition-fuel}
and \ref{fig:constanttransition-spentfuel} demonstrate the capability 
of \deploy to deploy reactor and supporting facilities to meet the user 
determined power demand and subsequently demanded secondary commodities 
with minimal time steps with an undersupply. 
Table \ref{tab:transition-scenario-results} shows the number of time 
steps where there is undersupply for each commodity in this scenario. 
In figure \ref{fig:constanttransition-power}, there are no time steps
where the supply of power falls under demand.
By using a combination of using the fast fourier transform method for predicting 
demand and setting the supply buffer to 3000MW (the capacity of 3 reactors), 
the user is able to minimize the number of time steps where there 
is an undersupply of every commodity. 
It is important to perform a small sensitivity analysis of the size 
of buffer to use for each commodity to ensure that there is no 
undersupply based on the nuances of the facility type: 
refueling in a reactor etc. 

In figure \ref{fig:constanttransition-fuel},
a facility with a large throughput of fuel is initially
deployed to meet the large initial fuel demand for the starting
up of ten reactors. 
By having an initial facility with a large throughput
exist for the first few time steps in the simulation,
\deploy is prevented from deploying a large amount of supporting
facilities that end up being redundant at the later parts of 
the simulation.   
This is a reflection of reality where reactor manufacturers will 
accumulate an appropriate amount of fuel inventory before starting 
up reactors. 
There is one time step where there is an undersupply after the 
decommissioning of the large initial facility.  
This is unavoidable since the prediction methods in \deploy are 
unable to predict this sudden drop in demand.

In this section, a transition scenario with a linearly 
increasing power demand is shown. 
Table \ref{tab:transition-scenario-growing-power} shows the 
simulation parameters used in this transition scenario. 

Figures \ref{fig:growingtransition-power}, \ref{fig:growingtransition-fuel}
and \ref{fig:growingtransition-spentfuel} demonstrate the capability 
of \deploy to deploy reactor and supporting facilities to meet the
power demand and subsequently demanded secondary commodities 
for a linearly increasing power demand. 
The fast fourier transform method for predicting power demand is used for 
this scenario
which is similar to what was used for the constant power demand 
transition scenario. 
A smaller supply buffer for power was used. 

\subsection{\textbf{Transition Scenario: Sinusoidal Demand}}
In this section, a transition scenario with sinusoidal
power demand is shown. 
A sinusoidal power demand is the reflection of power demand in 
the real world where power usage is higher in the winter and summer
and lower in the spring and fall. 
Table \ref{tab:transition-scenario-sine-power} shows the 
simulation parameters used in this transition scenario. 

Figures \ref{fig:sinetransition-power}, \ref{fig:sinetransition-fuel}
and \ref{fig:sinetransition-spentfuel} demonstrate the capability 
of \deploy to deploy reactor and supporting facilities to meet the
power demand and subsequently demanded secondary commodities 
for a sinusoidal power demand. 

For a sinusoidal power demand, the use of the triple exponential method
for predicting demand is more effective than the 
fast fourier transform method which was used for the constant 
and linearly increasing power demand transition scenarios. 
This is because the triple exponential smoothing method excels in
forecasting data points for repetitive seasonal series of data.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper describes the capabilities of \deploy, demonstrates 
the use of \deploy for an assortment of transition scenarios: 
constant power demand, linearly increasing power demand and
sinusoidal power demand.  
It also provides insights on parameter inputs to ease the
setting up of larger transition scenarios that include many facilities. 
Future work includes setting up similar power demand transition 
scenarios for extended nuclear fuel cycles that incorporate reprocessing 
facilities etc. 
A more realistic transition scenario could be explored such as an 
increasing power demand that has a sinusoidal pattern to represent 
seasons in a year for a growing power demand trend.
